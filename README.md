# Employee-Directory

## Purpose

Create an employee directory with React. This assignment will require breaking up application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

## Design

### User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

### Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
